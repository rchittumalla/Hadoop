Queries :

Q1. Load the data using the piggy bank jar file by skipping the header.  
raw_data = LOAD '/user/jayantm/Batch43/CUTe/PartA/CUTe_dataset.csv' USING org.apache.pig.piggybank.storage.CSVExcelStorage(';', 'NO_MULTILINE', 'UNIX', 'SKIP_INPUT_HEADER')
             AS (YEAR:int, MONTH: int, UC:chararray,
                 OAIRID:chararray, DAIRID:chararray,
                 DDELAY:int, ADELAY:int, CANCELLED:int);

Q2.  Print the first 10 records to the console. 
limit_10 = LIMIT raw_data  10; 
dump limit_10 

Q3. Find the Average departure delay for each airport.
group_by_departure_airport =  GROUP raw_data BY OAIRID;
avg_delay_departure_airport = FOREACH group_by_departure_airport  GENERATE group ,AVG(raw_data.DDELAY) AS avg_departure_delay;
dump avg_delay_departure_airport 

Q4. Find the average arrival delay for each airport. 
group_by_arrival_airport =  GROUP raw_data BY DAIRID;
avg_delay_arrival_airport = FOREACH group_by_departure_airport  GENERATE group ,AVG(raw_data.ADELAY) as avg_arrival_delay;
dump avg_delay_arrival_airport 

Q5.  Find the 5 worst airports based on average arrival delay and average departure delay.

sol 1 : average arrival delay
avg_delay_departure_airport_ordered =  ORDER avg_delay_departure_airport BY avg_departure_delay DESC;
worst_departures = LIMIT avg_delay_departure_airport_ordered 5;
dump worst_departures 

sol 2 : average departure delay
avg_delay_arrival_airport_ordered =  ORDER avg_delay_arrival_airport BY avg_arrival_delay DESC;
worst_arrivals = LIMIT avg_delay_arrival_airport_ordered 5;
dump worst_arrivals 

Q6. Perform joins on the raw data with the average arrival delay for the relevant arrival and departure airports. 
join_arrival_delay = JOIN raw_data BY OAIRID, avg_delay_departure_airport BY group;
join_both_delay = JOIN join_arrival_delay BY DAIRID, avg_delay_arrival_airport BY group;

Go store data into HDFS : 
STORE raw_data INTO '/user/2075B43/raw_data' USING PigStorage('\t');
STORE limit_10 INTO '/user/2075B43/top10records' USING PigStorage('\t');
STORE worst_arrivals INTO '/user/2075B43/worst_arrival_airports' USING PigStorage('\t');
STORE worst_departures INTO '/user/2075B43/worst_departure_airports' USING PigStorage('\t');
STORE join_arrival_delay INTO '/user/2075B43/join_arrival_delay' USING PigStorage('\t');
STORE join_both_delay INTO '/user/2075B43/join_both_delay' USING PigStorage('\t');
